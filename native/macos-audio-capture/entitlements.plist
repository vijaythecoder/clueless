    SECURITY HARDENED ENTITLEMENTS
    Following principle of least privilege - only requesting minimal permissions
    required for audio capture functionality.
    -->
    
    <!-- Required for accessing audio input devices for meeting transcription -->
    <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
    <true/>
    
    <!-- Required for accessing microphone for real-time audio capture -->
    <key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>

    <!--
    REMOVED DANGEROUS ENTITLEMENTS (Security Assessment):
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit (JIT compilation not needed)
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory (major security risk)
    - com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection (memory corruption risk)
    - com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation (library injection risk)
    
    These entitlements were removed to maintain macOS security protections
    while preserving all required functionality for audio capture.

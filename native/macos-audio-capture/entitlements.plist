    SECURITY HARDENED ENTITLEMENTS
    Following principle of least privilege - only requesting minimal permissions
    required for audio capture functionality.

    <!-- Required for accessing audio input devices for meeting transcription -->
    <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
    <true/>
    
    <!-- Required for accessing microphone for real-time audio capture -->
    <key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>

    <!--
    SECURITY NOTE: Screen Recording Entitlement Explained
    
    The screen-capture entitlement is required because this app uses ScreenCaptureKit
    to capture system audio for meeting transcription. ScreenCaptureKit requires
    screen recording permissions even when only capturing audio, as it's part of
    the unified screen capture API introduced in macOS 13.0.
    
    This is a legitimate use case for meeting transcription apps that need to
    capture system audio (e.g., from video calls, presentations, etc.).
    
    REMOVED DANGEROUS ENTITLEMENTS (Security Assessment):
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit (JIT compilation not needed)
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory (major security risk)
    - com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection (memory corruption risk)
    - com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation (library injection risk)
    
    These entitlements were removed to maintain macOS security protections
    while preserving all required functionality for audio capture.
